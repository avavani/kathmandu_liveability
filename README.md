**Final Project Report: Urban Environmental and Social Vulnerability Mapping of Kathmandu**
This project was developed as a final assignment for the "AI for Urban Sustainability" course. The primary objective is to assess and visualize the environmental and social vulnerabilities of Kathmandu, Nepal, by leveraging open-source datasets and geospatial AI techniques. The project was done in 4 parts. 
1) Using building footprint data from OpenStreetMap, a binary Random Forest Model was used to create the building footprint density of the city. 
2) Using the Digital Elevation Model from NASA, flooding was modeled to create an inundation dataset.
3) Using Landsat 8 data from Google Earth Engine, NDVI values for the entire city were calculated. 
4) Finally, all of these datasets were normalized and combined with wealth distribution data from the 2021 Nepal census to create a vulnerability map. The final product of this can be seen below.
